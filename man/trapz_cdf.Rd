\title{Trapezoidal CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) Calculation}
\usage{
trapz_cdf(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the independent variable values (e.g.,
time or space). It should have a length of at least 2.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector or matrix representing the dependent variable
values. If a vector is provided, it will be treated as a single series. If
a matrix is provided, each column will be treated as a separate series of
dependent variables.}
}
\value{
If `y` is a vector, returns a numeric vector containing the CDF
  values. If `y` is a matrix, returns a matrix where each column represents
  the CDF values for the corresponding series in `y`.
}
\description{
This function calculates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a set
of data points using the trapezoidal rule. The trapezoidal rule approximates
the integral of a function by summing up the areas of trapezoids formed
between consecutive points.
}
\details{
The CDF is computed by numerically integrating `y` with respect to
  `x` using the trapezoidal rule. The integration is performed by summing the
  areas of trapezoids formed between consecutive `x` values. The function is
  vectorized to support both univariate and multivariate input.

\examples{
# Example with a simple vector input for y
x <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)
y <- sin(x)
cdf <- trapz_cdf(x, y)
plot(x, cdf, type = "l", main = "CDF using Trapezoidal Rule", xlab = "x", ylab = "CDF")

# Example with a matrix input for y (multiple series)
y_matrix <- cbind(sin(x), cos(x))
cdf_matrix <- trapz_cdf(x, y_matrix)
matplot(x, cdf_matrix, type = "l", col = c("red", "blue"),
main = "CDF of Multiple Series", xlab = "x", ylab = "CDF")
