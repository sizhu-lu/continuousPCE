\title{Gradient of the FGM Copula}
\usage{
fgm_copula_gradient(u, v, rho)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{A numeric vector of uniform random variables representing the first
set of inputs. The values must be in the range (0, 1).}

\item{v}{A numeric vector of uniform random variables representing the second
set of inputs. The values must be in the range (0, 1).}

\item{rho}{A numeric scalar between -1 and 1, representing the correlation
parameter of the FGM copula.}
}
\value{
A list containing two components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{cu}: A numeric vector of the gradient of the FGM copula with respect to `u`.
  \item \code{cv}: A numeric vector of the gradient of the FGM copula with respect to `v`.
}
}
\description{
This function computes the gradients of the FGM (Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern)
copula with respect to both components `u` and `v`. The gradients represent
how sensitive the copula values are to changes in `u` and `v`. These
gradients are useful in various optimization tasks, such as in maximum
likelihood estimation for copula-based models or other applications involving
copula gradients.
}
\details{
The gradient of the FGM copula is calculated with respect to both
`u` and `v`. For each element of `u` and `v`, the function computes the
partial derivatives of the FGM copula with respect to the first and second
inputs, respectively. This is useful when working with the FGM copula in
optimization algorithms or sensitivity analysis.

The gradients are computed as follows: \deqn{c_u = \frac{\partial
C(u,v)}{\partial u} = -2 \rho (1 - 2v)} \deqn{c_v = \frac{\partial
C(u,v)}{\partial v} = -2 \rho (1 - 2u)} where \eqn{C(u, v)} is the FGM
copula, and \eqn{\rho} is the correlation parameter of the copula.
