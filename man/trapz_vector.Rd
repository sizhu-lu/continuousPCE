\title{Trapezoidal Integration for Vectors (Numerical Approximation)}
\usage{
trapz_vector(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the x-axis values, assumed to be
ordered. The length of `x` should match the length of `y` (or be compatible
if `y` is a matrix or array).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector, matrix (can be high dimensional), or array
representing the y-axis values. If `y` is a matrix or array, the
integration will be performed along the first axis (rows). So the first
dimension of `y` should have the same length as `x`.}
}
\value{
A numeric value or vector (depending on the input) representing the
  result of the trapezoidal integration. If `y` is a matrix or array, the
  result will be a vector of integrated values along the first axis (rows).
}
\description{
Perform trapezoidal numerical integration of `y` with respect to `x`, always
along the first axis (rows). This function computes the area under the curve
defined by `y` as a function of `x` using the trapezoidal rule.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Simple trapezoidal integration for vectors
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
result <- trapz_vector(x, y)

# Example 2: Integration with a matrix `y`
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 5, ncol = 3)
result <- trapz_vector(x, y)
