\title{Vectorized Weighting Function}
\usage{
identity_weighting_function_vectorized(s1, s0)
}
\arguments{
\item{s1}{A numeric vector representing the first set of input values (e.g.,
one dimension of the data).}

\item{s0}{A numeric vector representing the second set of input values (e.g.,
another dimension of the data).}
}
\value{
A numeric array with dimensions `length(s1) x length(s0)`. All values
  in the array are set to 1.
}
\description{
This function generates a matrix of weights where each entry is set to 1,
representing a simple weighting scheme. It computes the matrix in a
vectorized fashion, efficiently handling multiple input sizes. The function
is primarily useful when a constant weight (1) is required between two sets
of values, such as in certain copula-related calculations or in exploratory
data analysis.
}
\examples{
# Example: Generate a weighting matrix for two input vectors
s1 <- 1:3
s0 <- c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)
W <- identity_weighting_function_vectorized(s1, s0)

# Display the resulting weight matrix
print(W)
